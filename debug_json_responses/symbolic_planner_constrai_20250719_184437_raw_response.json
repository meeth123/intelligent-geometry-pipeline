An equilateral triangle with a side length of 100 has an inradius of `s / (2√3) = 100 / (2√3) ≈ 28.868`, not 50. To generate a valid geometric solution, the 'inscribed' constraint was treated as the primary requirement. The circle's radius was fixed at the specified value of 50. Consequently, the properties of the equilateral triangle were derived to perfectly inscribe this circle. The required side length for the triangle is `s = r * 2√3 = 50 * 2√3 = 100√3 ≈ 173.205`. The coordinate system is centered at the common center of the two objects, with the triangle's base oriented horizontally for stability.\",\n    \"coordinate_system\": {\n        \"origin\": \"center\",\n        \"units\": \"cm\",\n        \"x_axis\": \"right_positive\",\n        \"y_axis\": \"up_positive\"\n    },\n    \"solved_objects\": [\n        {\n            \"object_id\": \"b7c96f2a\",\n            \"type\": \"circle\",\n            \"coordinates\": {\n                \"center_x\": 0,\n                \"center_y\": 0,\n                \"radius\": 50\n            },\n            \"calculated_properties\": {\n                \"area\": 7853.982,\n                \"perimeter\": 314.159,\n                \"bounding_box\": {\n                    \"min_x\": -50,\n                    \"min_y\": -50,\n                    \"max_x\": 50,\n                    \"max_y\": 50\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"object_id\": \"50a66008\",\n            \"type\": \"triangle\",\n            \"coordinates\": {\n                \"center_x\": 0,\n                \"center_y\": 0,\n                \"vertices\": [\n                    [0, 100],\n                    [-86.603, -50],\n                    [86.603, -50]\n                ],\n                \"rotation_angle\": 0\n            },\n            \"calculated_properties\": {\n                \"side_length\": 173.205,\n                \"area\": 12990.381,\n                \"perimeter\": 519.615,\n                \"bounding_box\": {\n                    \"min_x\": -86.603,\n                    \"min_y\": -50,\n                    \"max_x\": 86.603,\n                    \"max_y\": 100\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"constraint_verification\": [\n        {\n            \"constraint_type\": \"inscribed\",\n            \"objects_involved\": [\n                \"b7c96f2a\",\n                \"50a66008\"\n            ],\n            \"mathematical_check\": \"For an inscribed circle (incircle), the distance from the triangle's center to each side must equal the circle's radius.
