A critical conflict exists: the 'vision' objects form a 45-degree angle, but a constraint specifies an 'intended_acute_angle' of 85 degrees. My primary role is to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, I will treat the abstract object definitions and the 'intended_acute_angle' constraint as the ground truth. I will map the abstract objects to the 'vision' object IDs and solve for a new geometry that satisfies the 85-degree angle constraint, while using the 'vision' objects' general layout (horizontal parallel lines) as a template for a clear and simple design.
